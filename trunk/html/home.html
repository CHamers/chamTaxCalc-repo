    <h1>The overall function and purpose of taxation in a modern economy</h1>
    <h2>The economic function of taxation</h2>
    <p>The UK government raises billions of pounds in taxation every year and the system of taxation and spending by government impacts on the whole economy of a country.</p>
    <p>Taxation policies have been used to influence many economic factors such as inflation, employemnet levels, imports/exports, etc.</p>
    <p>Taxation policies can also influence the behaviour of individuals and businesses, which will tehn have an effect on the economy of the country.</p>
    <p>Examples of this influence may be:
        <ul>
            <li>Using interest rate changes to encourage either spending or saving</li>
            <li>Encouraging individuals to save and invest, by offereing tax incentives such as those for Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) or personal pension plans (PPPs), etc.</li>
            <li>Encouraging charitalbe giving by offerint tax relief on donations and gifts.</li>
            <li>Encouraging entrepreneurs to build their own businesses by offering  capital gains tax reliefs sucha s business asset disposal relief and rollover relief.</li>
            <li>Encouraging businesses to invest in plant and machinery by offering capital allowances.</li>
            <li>Increasin car tax to try to cut down CO&#8322; emissions.</li>
            <li>Discouraging smoking and drinking alcohol by increasing tax on these goods.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>The social justice purpose of taxation</h2>
    <p>The type of taxation structure imposed has a direct impact on the redistribution of the wealth of a country. The main ways of structuring the tax system are listed below.</p>
    <h3>Proportional taxation</h3>
    <p>As income rises, the proportion of tax remains constant. For example, a proportional tax is one that takes 20&#37; of all earnings regardless of their level.</p>
    <h3>Progressive taxation</h3>
    <p>As income rises, the tax rate also rises. An example of this would be a tax rate of 10&#37; on the first &#163;100,000 of income, rising to a rate of 40&#37; on the next &#163;400,000 of income.</p>
    <p>The UK's system of income tax is an example of a progressive tax system.</p>
    <h3>Regressive taxation</h3>
    <p>As income rises, the proportion of taxation paid falls. An example of this would be a tax on fuel that nust be paid by both low and high earners It would be described as regressive beacuse the amount of tax represents a greater proportion of the lower earner's income.</p>
    <h3>Ad valorem principle</h3>
    <p>This is the percentage of tax added to the value of goods. An example of this would be 20&#37; VAT on most goods sold in the UK. VAT is said to be a regressive tax as a low earner will spend more of their income on tax than a high earner.</p>

    <h2>Direct and indirect taxation</h2>
    <h3>Direct taxation</h3>
    <p>This is where a taxpayer pays their tax directly to HM Revenue &amp; Customs (HMRC). Examples of direct taxes inclued tax, cor
        
        poration tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax.</p>
    <h3>Indirect taxation</h3>
    <p>this is where tax, such as VAT, is paid indirectly to HM Revenue &amp; Customs. the consumer pays indirect taxes to the supplier, who then pays the tax to HMRC.</p>

    <h1>Principal sources of revenue law and practice</h1>
    <h2>The structure of the UK tax system</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/ministers/chancellor-of-the-exchequer" rel="noreffer noopener" target="_blank"><b>The Chancellor of the Exchequer</b></a> has the overall responsibility for the UK tax system and one of his roles includes producint the Budget each year.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-treasury" rel="noreffer noopener" target="_blank"><b>The Treasury</b></a> is the ministry responsible under the Chancellor for the imposition and collection of taxation.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs" rel="noreffer noopener" target="_blank"><b>HM Revenue and Customs</b></a> (HMRC) is a single body that controls and administers all areas of the UK tax law. It is also responsible for the administration of certain statutory payments, such as child benefit and statutory maternity pay.</p>
    <h2>The different source of revenue law</h2>
    <p>Each year, following the Budget, the legislation is updated by passing a new <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/3/enacted" rel="noreffer noopener" target="_blank"><b>Finance Act</b></a>.</p>
    <p>In addition to Acts of Parliament, the government issues <b>statutory instruments</b> which add detail, where needed, to any part of the legislation. Statutory instruments are also often used to make changes to the provisions of the Acts, particularly if an Act was introduced without adequate consultation or scrutiny.</p>
    <p><b>Case law</b> is introduced as a result of decisions made in tax cases taken before the courts. The results of cases that have been through the courts can set a precedent for the tax treatment of ta particular item.</p>
    <p><b>Statements of practice</b> explain how HMRC believes the tax law should be applied in a particular situation.</p>
    <p><b>Extra-Statutory Concessions</b> are sometimes available to soften areas of tax law where it would seem to be unduly hars or unfair. These concessions usually have to be claimed and sometimes taxpayers are unaware that they are available. No new concessions are being introduced. Existing concessions are in the process of being written into legislation or withdrawn.</p>
    <h2>The interaction of the UK tax system with that of other tax jurisdictions</h2>
    <p>The UK tax system uses the concepts of residence and domicile to determine how an individual or busines is taxed. However, overseas countries have their own tax laws and practices.</p>
    <p>It is therefore possible for someone's income or gains to be liable to tax in more than one country at the same time, under completely different tax rules. As this is unfair, the countries concerned may draw up a dboule taxation agreement.</p>
    <p>A double taxation agreement or treaty between two countries may over-rule the tax law of one or both of those countries. In this case, the individual or entity is taxed in accordance with the tax treaty.</p> 
    <p>A double taxation agreement will typically contain the following:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>exemption clauses whereby some income and gains are taxable in one country but exempt in the other</li>
        <li>an agreement on the level of taxation to be applied to some types of income in both countries, and</li>
        <li>a credit relief clause: this usually specifies that relief should be given for any overseas tax suffered. Teh credit is usually limited to the lower of the overseas tax suffered and th UK tax payable on the same income. This effectively ensures that, although the income is taxable in both courntreis, it only suffers tax once.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Tax avoidance and tax evasion</h1>
    <h2>The difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion</h2>
    <p>It is important to know the difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion, as the consequences of getting it wrong can be very different.</p>
    <h3>Tax avoidance</h3>
    <p>Tax avidance is <b>legal</b>. It involves complying with the tax legislation in such a way as to minimise a taxpayer's tax liability.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For example, an individual arranging their will in such a way as to minimise their inheritance tax liability is using tax planning opportunities and avoiding tax in a legal way in accordance with the tax law.</li>
        <li>Another example may be an individual making a capital gains tax election to tax the disposal of thier business in such a way as to minimise thier capital gains tax liability.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tax evasion</h3>
    <p>Tax evasion is <b>illegal</b>. It involves reducint the tax liability in a way that is not following the tax legislation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For example, tax evsion is deliberately omitting some investment income from a tax return in order not to pay tax ont aht source of income.</li>
        <li>Another example of tax evasion its to overstate expenses, in order to reduce the tax liability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any taxpayer who carries out tax evasion could face criminal prosecution, including penalites, interest and sometimes imprisonment.</p>
    <p>If a tax adviser believes that a client has been involved in tax evasion, they should advise the client of the implications of their actions and recommend that the client makes a full disclosure to HMRC. If the client refuses to do so, the tax advsier should conseder ceasing to act for them.</p>
    <p>If the tax adviser does cease to act, they must advise HMRC taht they no longer act for this client, but they should not tell HMRC why they have ceased to act as this would break the client's confidentiality.</p>
    <p>As tax evasion is a crime, the adviser should also make a report under the money laundering regulations.</p>
    <h2>The General Anti-Abuse Rule (GAAR)</h2>
    <p>Although tax avoidance is legal, tehre are occasions when taxpayers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>behave in ways that were not anticipated at the time the legislation was enacted, or</li>
        <li>use loophole in the legislation to reduce their liability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This type of behaviour is sometimes referred to as &#39;aggressive&#39; tax avoidance. It results in the Government losing tax that it had expected to be able to collect.</p>
    <p>In the past, the Government has targeted aggressive tax avoidance and closed loopholes by using specific anti-avoidance legislation. The problem wit this approach is that it takes place after the tax has been lost. It involves reacting to the action taken by taxpayers instead of anticipating it in advance. It also results in teh tax system becoming more and more complicated, which may inadvertently result in the cration of more loopholes.</p>
    <p>In order to provide a further deterrent, the tax system contains a General Anit-Abuse Rule (GAAR). This is intended to counteract <b>tax advantages</b> arising from <b>tax arrangements</b> that are <b>abusive</b>.</p>
    <p>The terms used in the above definitiaon have the following meanings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>&#39;Tax advantages&#39; </b>include increased tax deductions, reduced tax liabilities, deferrral of tax payments and advancement of tax repayments.</li>
        <li><b>&#39;Tax arrangements&#39;</b> are arrangements where the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of the arrangements is obtaining a tax advantage.</li>
        <li>Arrangements are <b>&#39;abusive&#39;</b> where they cannot reasonably be regarded as a reasonable course of action, for example, where they include contrived steps or are intended to take advantage of shortcomings in the tax legislation. This is known as teh double reasonableness test.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Where the GAAR applies, HMRC may counteract the tax advantages by, for example, increasint the taxpayer's tax liability by an amount is just and reasonable. They must follow a specific procedure if they want to do this, which inclueds presenting their case to an independent Advisory Panel. the burden of proof rests with HMRC to show that the GAAR applies.</p>
