        <h1>Income Tax and NIC liabilities</h1>
        <h2>Income Tax</h2>
        <p>Income tax is payable by individuals on their earned income, such as employment income, self-employment
            income
            and pension income.</p>
        <p>It is collected from employees using the Pay As You Earn (PAYE) system, and from self-employed individuals
            using
            the self assessment system.</p>
        <p>Income tax is also payable by individuals on their other income, such as bank interest, dividend and rental
            income.</p>
        <h2>National insurance contributions (NICs)</h2>
        <p>NICs are payable by most individuals who are either employed or self-employed. NICs are also payable by
            businesses in respect of their employees.</p>

        <h2>1. Overview of income tax</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Taxable income</h3>
        <p>Individulas are liable to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>income tax on their taxable income, and</li>
            <li>a separate tax, capital gains tax, on their chargeable gains.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Taxble income is defined as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>income generated from all sources which is not specifically exempt, <b>minus</b></li>
            <li>deductible interest payments, trading losses and personal allowances.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Taxable income is listed in a taxable income statement according to its nature and source.</p>
        <h3>1.2 The tax year</h3>
        <p>Income tax rates and allowances are fixed for each tax year. A tax year is the period from 6 Arpil in one
            year to
            the following 5 April.</p>
        <p>Tax years are quoted as teh calendar years in which the tax year begins and ends. For example, the tax year
            2020&#47;21 is the period from 6 April 2020 to 5 April 2021.</p>
        <p>Income tax is based on the income relating to a particular tax year. For examinations during the period 1
            June
            2021 to 31 March 2022, questions will be based on the 2020&#47;21 tax year, i.e. the provisions contained in
            Finance Act 2020.</p>
        <p>The tax year is sometimes referred to as the <b>fiscal year</b> or the <b>year of assessment</b>.</p>
        <h3>1.3 Preparing an income tax computation</h3>
        There are three key steps in the preparation of an income tax computation.
        <h4>Step 1: Prepare a statement of taxable income for the tax year</h4>
        <p>The first step is to prepare a statement listing all the income that is chargeable to income tax in the tax
            year,
            after deducting allowable interest payments, trading losses and personal allowants.</p>
        <p>This should be presented as follows:</p>

        <h4>Step 2: Calculate the income tax liability</h4>
        <p>The next step is to calculate the income tax liability on the taxable income. Income tax rates need to be
            applied
            carefully, as different types of income are taxed at different rates of tax.</p>

        <h4>Step 3: Calculate the income tax payable</h4>
        <p>The last step is to calculate how much of the income tax liability is still payable after taking account of
            any
            Pay As You Earn (PAYE) tax already deducted at source.</p>

        <h2>2. The taxable income statement</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Classification of income</h3>
        <p>Each source of income must be shown separatel in the statement, because the rules to determine the amount of
            income that is taxable are different for each source.</p>
        <p>In addition. it is important to group sources of income together, into non-savings income, savings income and
            dividend income. This is because different rates of tax apply to the different groups of taxable income.</p>
        <h3>2.2 Exempt income</h3>
        <p>The taxable income statement lists all taxable income that is not specifically exempt from income tax. There
            are
            many types of exempt income.</p>
        <p>The main types of exempt income are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>some social security benefits (e.g. child benefit, personal independence payment)</li>
            <li>the first &#163;30,000 of compensation for loss of office</li>
            <li>competition prizes, national lottery adn premium bond prizes, betting winnings</li>
            <li>income from ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts)</li>
            <li>interest on overpaid tax that has been repaid by HMRC</li>
            <li>interest on National Savings Certificates.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.3 Employment income</h3>
        <p>Employment income is likely to be the primary source of income for an employed individual. The amount of
            income
            assessable under the employment income rules is the total gross remuneration including gross salary, plus
            benefits such as the use of a company car etc. received in the tax year. Gross salary means the amount of
            income
            before pay-as-you-earn (PAYE) income tax has been deducted at source by the employer.</p>
        <h3>2.4 Trading income</h3>
        <p>Trading income is likely to be the primary source of income for a self-employed individual. It covers the
            profits
            of a trade, profession or vocation of a self-employed individual. The taxable trading income is based on the
            accounting results of the business.</p>
        <h3>2.5 Property income</h3>
        <p>The property income rules assess income received from land and buildings situated in the UK.</p>
        <h3>2.6 Savings income</h3>
        <p>Savings income consists mainly of interest income. Individuals are liable to income tax on the interest
            received
            in the tax year (i.e. a receipt basis of assessment). Interest is received on the date it is credited to the
            savings account.</p>
        <h4>Exempt interest</h3>
            <p>Some types of interest are exempt from income tax. The main types are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interest on ISAs (Individual Savings Accounts)</li>
                <li>Interest on National Savings Certificates</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>2.7 UK dividend income</h3>
            <p>Individuals are taxed on the dividentds received in the tax year (i.e. a receipt basis of assessment.</p>
            <h3>2.8 Deductible interest</h3>
            <p>Interest paid for <em>trading</em> purposes is deducted in calculation <em>trading</em> income. The main
                types of interest payments deductible from <em>total</em> income are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Interest on a loan taken out by an individual to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>purchase a share in,</li>
                        <li>increase a capital contributiona to,</li>
                        <li>make a loan to, or</li>
                        <li>purchase plant or machinery for use in a partnership in which the individual is a partner
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Interest on a loan taken out by an individual to purchase plant or machnery for usi in his
                    employment
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>These types of interest are paid gross by an individual.</p>
            <p>No relief is available for interest paid in respect of a mortgage to purchase the individual's residence
                or
                for credit card interest.</p>

            <h2>3. The personal allowance</h2>
            <h3>3.1 The personal allowance</h3>
            <p>Every individual is entitle to a personal allowance (PA). This is an amount of income that can be
                received
                free of tax.</p>
            <p>The PA is deducted from <b>net income</b>. Net income is defined as the total of income from all sources
                after teh deductio of qualifyig interest payments.</p>
            <p>Note that if net income is less than the PA, teh excess allowance is lost. For example, if an individual
                has
                net income of just &#163;4,000 in 2020&#47;21, the excess allowance of &#163;8,500 is lost.</p>
            <h3>3.2 Withdrawal of the personal allowance</h3>
            <p>If an individual's adjusted net income exceeds &#163;100,000 their PA is reduced by &#163;1 for every
                &#163;2
                of excess income. Therefore an individual with adjusted net income of &#163;125,000 or more will receive
                no
                PA &#40;&#163;100,000 +&#40;&#163;12,500 x 2&#41;&#41;</p>
            <p class="warning">Adusted net income is net income as calculated above less the gross amount of:
                <ul class="warning">
                    <li>Personal pension contributions, and</li>
                    <li>Gift Aid donations</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Personal pension contributions and Gift Aid donations are paid net of basic rate income tax. For example,
                if
                an individual makes a personal pension conribution of Gift Aid payment of &#163;800, the payment is
                treated
                as a gross amount of &#163;1,000 &#40; &#61;&#163;800 x 100&#47;80&#41;. The payments are not deducted
                in
                calculatin the individual's taxable income.</p>
            <p>An individual whose adjusted net income falls between &#163;100,000 and &#163;125,000 suffers an
                effective
                marginal rate &#40;the rate paid on the next pound they earn&#41; of income tax of 60&#37;. This is the
                higher rate of 40&#37; on income pluas an additional 40&#37; as a result of the withdrawal of the
                personal
                allowance. It may therefore be beneficial for such individuals to make additional personal pension
                contributions or Gift Aid donations.</p>
            <h3>3.3 The transferable amount of personal allowance</h3>
            <p>&#163;1,250 of the personal allowance can be transferred to an individual's spouse or civil partner. This
                transferable amount is known as the &#39;marriage allowance&#39;.</p>
            <p>The transfer is subject to the following conditions:
                <ul>
                    <li>The individuals concerned must be married or in a registered civil partnership for all or part
                        of
                        the tax year to which the election applies.</li>
                    <li>Neither spouse must be liable to tax at more than the basic rate. The basic rate threshold for
                        2020&#47;21 is &#163;37,500. &#40;This means that the marriage allowance cannot be used to save
                        tax
                        at the higher rates of 40&#37; or 45&#37;. It will only be of benefit where one spouse is unable
                        touse ehir full personal allowance.&#41;</li>
                    <li>The election must be made within four years of the end of the tax year to which it applies. If
                        an
                        election is made before the end of the tax year to which is applies, it will remain in force for
                        future tax years unless the electin is withdrawn or the conditions are no longer met.</li>
                    <li>An individual cannot give or receive more than one marriage allowance in a tax year,
                        irrespective of
                        whether they are a party to more than one marriage or civil partnership in that year.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="warning">The spouse who receives the marriage allowance does not deduct it from their
                income. Instead, it is converted
                into a tax reduction at the rate of 20&#37;</p>
            <p>The marriage allowance therefore entitles the recipient to the following deduction from their tax bill
                for
                2020&#47;21:</p>
            <p>&#163;1,250 x 20&#37; &#61; &#163;250</p>
            <p>The deduction cannot create a repayment, i.e. it cannot reduce the recipient's tax liability below nil.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Computation of income tax</h2>
            <h3>4.1 Overview of the income tax computation</h3>
            <p>Different rates of income tax apply to the different sources of income. Before calculatin the income tax,
                it
                is first necessary to deduct from the appropriate sources of income:
                <ul>
                    <li>deductible interest, and</li>
                    <li>the PA.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>These deductions should be set-off in the following order:
                <ol>
                    <li>Non-savings income &#40;i.e. income other than savings income and dividends&#41;, then</li>
                    <li>Savings income &#40;i.e. interest income&#41;, then</li>
                    <li>Dividend income.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>An easy method to ensure the correct allocation of the taxable income computation as follows:</p>
